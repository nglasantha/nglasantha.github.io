### 1. Introduction
Many organizations have started adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) with high expectations. A common question is: “We invested in AI. Why don’t we see clear ROI?”

This reflects a widespread phenomenon: technology can improve individual work long before measurable organizational results appear. This is similar to the Solow Paradox, observed decades ago during the computer revolution.

### 2. The Solow Paradox — A Simple Summary
In 1987, economist Robert Solow observed that computers were everywhere except in productivity statistics.

The lesson: technology adoption moves faster than organizational change. Productivity numbers only improved once companies redesigned workflows and decision processes to take full advantage of new capabilities.

### 3. AI Is Repeating the Solow Paradox
AI is currently in the "individual impact" phase:
*   Individuals can complete tasks faster and more accurately
*   Organizations still operate within old workflows

This does not mean AI is failing — it shows that the system has not yet adapted to the new capabilities.

### 4. AI Productivity Starts at the Task Level
AI is already effective at improving individual tasks in IT:
*   Drafting code and creating test cases
*   Summarizing requirements and documents
*   Supporting technical decision-making

At the task level, productivity improvements are real. Translating these gains to organizational-level results takes time.

### 5. The "Jevons Effect": Why Saved Time Stays in the System
When tasks become faster, people usually don’t work less. Instead, the extra capacity is used to:
*   Produce higher-quality work
*   Handle more complex tasks
*   Complete preventive or refactoring work

Even though metrics may not reflect time savings, these improvements provide significant long-term value.

### 6. Why Jira Ticket Counts May Not Increase
Even tools that measure output, like Jira, may not show immediate gains:
*   **The Slowest Step Wins:** A ticket closes only when all steps (development, QA, approvals) are complete. AI accelerates some steps, but bottlenecks remain.
*   **Invisible Gains:** AI enables preventive work, refactoring, and stability improvements that are not tracked as new tickets.
*   **Analogy:** AI strengthens the engine, but Jira measures car speed — and the traffic lights are still red.

### 7. Human-Level Productivity Gains
AI reduces cognitive load by handling repetitive and mental tasks. This allows:
*   Flow state work
*   Reduced burnout
*   More capacity for strategic thinking

Even if these benefits are not reflected in metrics, they improve overall productivity and decision-making quality.

### 8. Role Evolution: From "Creator" to "Director"
AI shifts work from execution to oversight:
*   **Before AI:** Employees spend most of their time “creating” (typing, formatting).
*   **With AI:** Employees spend more time reviewing, directing, and deciding.

Value moves from speed of execution to quality of judgment.

### 9. AI as a Diagnostic Tool
AI highlights where organizational processes slow down:
*   **Example:** AI can generate a feature in 10 minutes, but approvals take three days.
*   **Insight:** The bottleneck is in the workflow, not in task execution.

AI thus acts as a diagnostic lens, revealing opportunities for future improvement.

### 10. When to Optimize vs. When to Redesign
Understanding AI impact requires distinguishing between speeding up tasks and changing workflows:

| Scenario | Action | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Task is repetitive but well-defined | Optimize | Time is saved on routine work |
| Task is delayed due to handoffs or approvals | Redesign | Waiting time is reduced or eliminated |
| Task requires constant human checks | Redesign | Workflow is automated for efficiency |

### 11. Conclusion
AI is producing real productivity improvements, but these are often invisible to traditional organizational metrics.
*   Gains appear first at the task and individual level
*   System-level measurements may take months or years to reflect changes
*   AI also exposes bottlenecks and workflow inefficiencies, revealing where organizational adaptation may be required

The challenge is not that AI fails to deliver value — it is that organizations take time to absorb and manifest that value in measurable outcomes.
